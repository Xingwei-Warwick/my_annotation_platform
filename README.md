# my_annotation_platform
This is the code of the annotation platform for some of my research project


`create_progress_file.py` is used for generating the task files, which are little chunks of tasks split from the whole data file. The task files will later be used in generating the progress files for each user.


`init_user_group.py` can generate a progress recording file for each user based on a source file. A pair of username and password are generated for each user.


`annotation_platform.py` is the main page for the platform, which can record the authorization and progress


The *pages* directory contains the guideline and conclusion (annotation verification).
