# my_annotation_platform
This is the code of the annotation platform for some of my research project


*init_user_group.py* can generate a progress recording file for each user based on a source file. A pair of username and password are generated for each user.


*create_progress_file.py* is used for generating the source files that will be used in generating the progress files for each user.


*annotation_platform.py* is the main page for the platform, which can record the authorization and progress

The *pages* directory contains the guideline and conclusion (annotation verification).
